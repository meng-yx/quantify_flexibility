## Proof-of-concept scripts to quantify the conformational flexibility of AF2 models for MaSIF

**Considerations:**
- Per-residue/Per-atom score or Pairwise matrix?
- Generalisable to any molecule, not just proteins
- Directional vectors or quantitative scale?

**Potential methods:**
- Normal Mode Analysis (NMA)
- MOlecular Dynamics Simulation or Force Field
- Repacking (e.g. https://github.com/Kuhlman-Lab/PIPPack)
